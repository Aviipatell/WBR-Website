            <h3>What pushed you to launch your own business in the clean tech industry?
            </h3>

            <p>I have spent 15 years in the clean tech space, working as an engineer and product developer. When I went
                to a global sustainability conference in Vancouver, I heard keynote speakers that were so impressive
                that they inspired me to make more of an impact. It wasn’t until I heard those motivational speakers
                that I thought to myself, “These women are really doing it and making a difference”. Thus, I began
                looking for a project that would be the right fit. This was when I saw the MaRS Cleantech Challenge. The
                MaRS Cleantech Challenge is a program that supports women for 2.5 years to build a company. In the past,
                I always knew I wanted a start-up at some point, but I was just waiting to find the right technology and
                business opportunity. I worked with lots of big companies, small companies and start-ups to get a good
                lay of the land about how to effectively move something forward. The competition was meant for women
                innovators, but at the time I did not have a technology of my own, so I contacted MaRS to see if they
                were willing to support somebody who would license a technology. So, I went to the UW Commercialization
                Office and asked them, “would you support me in this?” I was working at their office of research at the
                time, which worked out in my favour. They opened up their books and said, “pick one technology from the
                intellectual property portfolio, and start a company with it.” After scanning 5 out of 6 potential
                technologies, 3 were of particular interest to me. I decided on Evercloak because there were a lot of
                opportunities for it in the cleantech space, so we applied it to a real life scenario. Along with
                co-founder Dr. Michael Pope, we were successful in turning Evercloak into a company by licensing the
                technology with the University of Waterloo.
            </p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="journeyGraph" src="" alt="Startup Journey Process">

            <h3>You are working towards tackling environmental issues using your unique technology. How do you think
                other businesses can implement Corporate Social Responsibility into their business models to maximize
                societal benefit?</h3>

            <p>The initial use case of our technology is to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emitted by the air
                conditioning market. Currently, 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions are from air conditioning and
                this percentage is expected to triple by 2050. So our aim with our first use case is to develop
                nanomembranes that can remove moisture from the air and essentially remove the energy required to cool
                air by removing the humidity first. With that, we have made a significant impact by reducing our energy
                use by almost 50%.
            </p>

            <h3>Which environmental issues do you plan to tackle with the implementation of this technology?
            </h3>

            <p>We’re looking to significantly reduce the energy used by air conditioning units through developing a
                membrane that efficiently removes moisture from the air. To cool air, air conditioning systems have to
                lower air temperature, and remove water vapour in the air. The current method that air conditioners use
                to remove water vapour is by condensing it, which makes it a very energy intensive process. The air
                conditioners have to overcool the air in order to remove the water vapour in cases where there is a lot
                of humidity. Thus, our technology has been able to resolve this problem by dehumidifying the air before
                it’s cooled, significantly decreasing the energy usage.</p>

            <h3>Where do you first plan on applying your nanofilm technology?</h3>

            <p>We have a pilot project with a large North American power producer. They’re helping us to validate our
                membrane material for this use case. Our first application will be in a power plant situation where
                humidity is a big challenge as it causes corrosion and mould. Thus, there are a lot of industrial
                applications that are interested in an energy efficient way to remove moisture from their facilities.
                Our initial feature market is to target industrial and commercial dehumidification space and then
                eventually tie it into residential applications through air conditioning. Air purification only removes
                water vapour from air and does not remove any pollutants, so there is lots of interest in the material
                we are making for desalination water treatment applications. </p>

            <img src="" alt="Market Strategy Idea" class="singleImage" id="marketStrat">

            <h3>How has your 15 years of experience in the design of industrial waste-water treatment systems helped you
                in launching Evercloak?
            </h3>

            <p>I have had broad experiences in engineering consulting, as I have worked in an engineering company
                building and designing manufacturing systems. My experiences in fund innovations have also helped me
                launch Evercloak. My diverse experiences have allowed me to rapidly move this company forward because I
                know how things work and the key processes associated with those operations. My experience in
                engineering consulting taught me how to engage with clients, as well.
            </p>

            <h3>How has MaRS helped Evercloak’s growth and success? </h3>

            <p>I would not be here without MaRS. MaRS has provided me with the opportunity to lead and develop a company
                for 2 and a half years. There are 6 of us in a cohort and we all get customized programming in all the
                fields that we need help in every quarter. Examples of programming include; accounting, sales,
                professional development, media training, non-verbal communication, manufacturing courses, and so on.
                Mentorship is also among the various supports. They essentially help us with everything we need to know
                as a CEO.
            </p>

            <h3>What was the process for producing your nanofilm material and ensuring its physical properties?
            </h3>

            <p>Our technology that we are commercializing is a platform technology. It is almost like an inkjet printer
                where we can take 2D materials like graphene, graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes that already exist and
                develop a way to make them into an ultra-thin film coating. Right now, there is no other way to make
                these thin film coatings in large areas and at low costs. This is our core technology. It’s similar to
                an inkjet printer printing on water since we create a layer on water and we are able to transfer that
                layer of material onto any other material. The physical properties of the nanofilm naturally come with
                the materials with which we are using to manufacture the nanofilm. All we are doing is enabling the
                nanofilm to coat a variety of materials which is currently not possible and opens up many commercial
                applications.
            </p>

            <h3>If you are crowned the winner of the Women in cleantech challenge, what will you use the prize money
                for?
            </h3>

            <p>The prize money will definitely help to scale the company and advance the technology further to secure
                follow-up funding. In a year to a year and a half from now, we will need the support of a bigger
                demonstration system to show potential clients, partners and investors that our company is ready to take
                things to the next level and secure follow-on growth funding from investors.
            </p>

            <h3>Do you have any advice that you would give to students at the University of Waterloo with an interest in
                entrepreneurship?
            </h3>

            <p>It definitely depends on the type of person and background. My network really helped me to succeed. I
                have received so much help from so many different people to get to where I am right now. This would not
                have been possible without my strong network that I already built from getting out and meeting new
                people, as you never know when you can use that network.
            </p>

            <h3>What advice would you give young women interested in starting their own entrepreneurial venture?
            </h3>

            <p>I would say to just go for it. If you’re interested in something, go and do it and know that there is
                nobody else better to do it than you. Ask yourself, “Why not me? Why not you? Why shouldn’t you?” Just
                go out and do what you’re passionate about.
