            <h3>The game is changing</h3>
            
            <p>Disney has garnered a reputation for being one of the most stable companies in the world, rooted in their deep history and strong brand. Beginning in 1923, Disney’s success started with their animation studio, creating memorable characters such as Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald Duck. Since then, Disney has expanded into the film industry, creating some of the world’s most well-known amusement parks, and added to their long list of memorable characters. Disney’s next steps have been prompted by a changing market that is moving towards on-demand video, specifically SVOD (streaming video on demand) services, with their announcement of Disney+.</p>
                
                
            <p>Disney+ is Disney’s newest venture in the SVOD industry that was announced on April 11th, 2019. The streaming service gives on-demand access to Disney’s exclusive content library spanning their key brands including Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, Disney Channel, and Pixar. The service will cost $7.00 USD a month, almost half the cost of competing services. American consumers can expect Disney+ to release in November of 2019.</p>
            
            <h3>The path to Disney+</h3> 
            
            <p>How did Disney set themselves up for Disney+? The company has made strategic acquisitions that have contributed to their successful digital content. Disney’s first step was to expand its film library with acquisitions of Pixar, Lucas films, and 21st Century Fox. All three of these acquisitions have been key to establishing Disney’s foothold in the film sector. Disney also acquired Bamtech and purchased a majority stake in Hulu, entering the SVOD market. Bamtech acts as the streaming platform for ESPN+, Disney’s SVOD service for sports, and will provide the streaming infrastructure for Disney+. Hulu, an independent streaming service, gave Disney valuable expertise and experience directly competing in the SVOD market. Together, all of these strategic acquisitions have contributed to the formation and launch of Disney+.</p>

            <h3>Bang on thread</h3>
            
            <p>Disney+ differentiates from the competition by providing easy and unlimited access to Disney content and tailoring the service specifically to families. Disney+ attempts not to replace current SVOD providers, but rather provides a family-oriented platform that consumers can buy in addition to their current streaming service. They have done so by segmenting their content by only including family-oriented content on Disney+. Children get access to the best content, and parents can be assured that their kids are watching appropriate shows. This is contrary to other SVOD services, as most of the content is targeted toward mature audiences.</p>

            <div class="imageContainer">

                <div class = "image" id = "img1"></div>

                <div class="image" id = "img2"></div>

            </div>

            <p>In addition to general content segmentation, the specific shows and movies featured on Disney+ appeal to individual family members. Disney channel and Disney Junior’s viewership consists of ages 2 -16, Marvel’s largest demographic were those between the ages of 16 – 20, Pixar films target younger children, and Star Wars is for ages 10+. While most of these brands are specifically targeted towards younger demographics, brands like Star Wars and Marvel also have a strong following among adults, including parents.</p> 
            
            <p>When looking at Disney+’s target market, younger children make up a large portion of the population and are increasingly being exposed to SVOD services. In 2018, it was estimated that 41.46% of American households had children under the age of 18. Within this demographic, screen time has significantly increased among children. Specifically, in 2017 children under the age of 8 spent up to 2:19 hrs on mobile devices which was double the amount in 2013. Coupled with the fact that 78% of families were subscribed to at least one SVOD service, SVOD viewership among younger children will inevitably increase significantly in the coming years. Disney+ as being solely focused on targeting younger demographics will be able to effectively take advantage of these trends versus competitors. Combined with a low starting cost, it is highly likely that Disney+ will be able to penetrate this market.</p>

            <h3>#1 in film</h3>

            <p>With Disney+, Disny is cancelling their licensing contracts with Netflix, resulting in billions lost in revenue. Hoever, the exclusivity of their content will prove to be far stronger than these short term losses. As mentioned earlier, Disney’s content library is expansive, and their studio has had tremendous success. Disney is the first studio to make over $5 billion consecutively over 3 years, while also holding the record for the highest grossing year of $7.6 billion in 2016. Their box office success will be a key driver for Disney+ adoption.</p>

            <p>While Pixar and Lucas entertainment has been successful, Marvel has been the main driver for box office sales. Since the debut of Marvel’s Cinematic Universe (MCU) in 2008, Marvel has had at least one movie rank in the top 10 for gross revenues every year. Recently, Avengers: Endgame became the fastest film to gross $2 billion USD.  Marvel has been Disney’s cash cow and will seemingly continue to produce results. Even stronger than Marvel’s box office success is their cultural impact. From challenging movie storytelling, to popularizing end credit scenes, Marvel has made a significant impact on the film industry. Marvel does a great job at not only appealing to comic fans but also introducing newcomers to the MCU through the 22 film universe. Watching Marvel films has become a norm among today’s moviegoers, and box office sales cement the MCU as being the most popular series in the film industry. This type of brand loyalty is akin to that of television series and will drive subscriptions for Disney+. To further understand the value that Marvel adds to Disney+’s success, consider HBO Now and Game of Thrones.</p>

            <p>HBO Now is the streaming service that was released by HBO in 2015 and features programming available on the HBO platform. The platform’s content is restricted to HBO, similar to Disney+. The main driver behind the platform’s success has been Game of Thrones (GOT). Similar to Marvel, GOT is universally watched by audiences and widely accepted as the most popular show. When looking at HBO Now’s subscription rates over the years, they jump significantly during the years in which Game of Thrones is featured. In 2017, subscriptions to HBO Now increased by 91% following the release of season 7. This demonstrates the impact that even one successful franchise can affect subscription numbers. While not a direct comparison, Marvel and GOT command similar levels of viewership loyalty, with fans eager to be the first to watch upcoming productions. However, unlike GOT, Marvel is accompanied by other successful studios like Pixar and Lucas Films, which will ensure sustainable subscriber growth.</p>

            <h3>Cutting through a crowded market</h3>
 
            <p>In a market filled with proven competitors, can Disney’s brand command users to adopt Disney+? Definitely. Disney’s brand value will drive subscriber growth despite the number of competitors in the SVOD streaming space. Disney’s brand has been perpetuated by their timeless characters coupled with their extensive history with consumers.</p>
 
            <p>When it comes to brand loyalty, Disney is king. Disney has shown its ability to provide quality experiences with families in particular. Disney targets not only children, but also children at heart. They’ve demonstrated the ability to simultaneously attract younger audiences and still appeal to older generations. Their branding strategy revolves around their characters and their ability to inspire. Disney’s characters are the main drivers behind Disney’s success, as they aggressively monetize them through multiple channels. Take Frozen for example, in addition to grossing  $1.3 billion USD at the box office, Disney has capitalized on the film’s success by releasing merchandise, songs, an ice show, and books. Frozen merchandise sales alone were estimated to be around $1 billion USD, almost equalling box office sales. The strength of Disney’s characters across multiple channels demonstrates the cross-branding success of their brands that will translate to Disney+ subscribership. Disney fans are encapsulated by their characters and will be willing to pay additional monthly fees to add Disney+ to their SVOD lineup.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, fans have already demonstrated the demand for easily accessible Disney content.  Looking at Disney’s home video sales, they have remained relatively strong in contrast to the market. While international physical home entertainment spending decreased by 36% from 2015 – 2018, Disney’s home video sales have only decreased by a mere 3% across this time period, with a 29% increase in sales from 2015 -2016. This demonstrates that the Disney brand, and subsequently their characters, resonate strongly with their audience, generating fairly stable sales within a declining market. Moreover, steady home video sales are indicative of consumer interest for on-demand Disney content. Coupled together, Disney+ will take advantage of an already existing demand for content, and further capitalize on their strong brand value.</p>

            <p>All things considered, the timing for Disney+’s launch is perfect. The company’s digital infrastructure, successful content library, and strong family brand are ripe to be capitalized on. Furthermore, the increasing use of SVOD services acts as a catalyst for subscriber growth. Disney once again has shown their ability to adapt and innovate in today’s changing market.</p>
