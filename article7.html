            <h3>Introduction
            </h3>

            <p>Lunaria solves the problem of diversity and inclusion in all spaces of the world by reframing the way
                people imagine diversity and inclusion. Right now, companies increasingly want to integrate diversity
                and inclusion (D&I) into their culture, but they are not taking a customized approach to their own
                needs. For example, something that is very common at the moment is D&I workshops and trainings. Lunaria
                encourages people to take a data-driven approach to diversity and inclusion by surveying their
                employees, tracking demographic information and determining their needs and investing in those needs.
                Lunaria equips companies with the information they need to choose the right diversity and inclusion
                initiatives to invest in. We then continuously evaluate their next steps and next goals and the
                effectiveness of their chosen initiatives.</p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="approachDiagram" src="" alt="Lunaria's Approach Diagram">

            <h3>What prompted the idea of wanting to work in D&I and what led you to the current solution you are
                working in now?
            </h3>

            <p>Lunaria has pivoted quite a bit since its inception. We initially started off working with nonprofits by
                performing impact evaluations. However, we found that we were getting asked to do more evaluations that
                focused on more than the direct outcomes of a program. If we were hired to evaluate a STEM program, we
                would measure not only the interest garnered and program effectiveness, but also the diversity of its
                participants for example. And so now, what we do is we work with our customers on finding different ways
                to measure the impact of diversity and inclusion; we measure with a data-driven approach on numerous
                metrics ranging from the impact of D&I initiatives to how people feel when accessing resources. The D&I
                industry is evolving out of the non-profit space too, as growing compliance requirements and new
                government regulations are being put in place which encourage companies to invest in D&I.
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of role does D&I play in an organization?</h3>

            <p>The American dream is at the heart of Forever 21. Created by husband-and-wife duo Do Won and Jin Sook
                Chang, the couple emigrated from South Korea to Los Angeles in 1981 in hopes of a better future. By
                1984, the Changs opened up the first Forever 21, then known as Fashion21 in California, making $700,000
                USD in sales in its first year. By 1989, the first mall store was opened, and the company went
                international in 2001 by opening their first Canadian retail store. At its peak, Forever 21 was
                generating 4.4B in revenue with over 700 stores worldwide; the Changs had gone from working class
                immigrants, to becoming billionaires [1]. They had achieved the American dream. However, all was brought
                to a halt with their recent bankruptcy filing. How did this American dream turn into a nightmare? What
                led Forever21 to file for bankruptcy in a market that is still heavily reliant on fast fashion brands?
                It is evident that Forever 21’s business strategy, marketing plan, and its focus on the “now” is the
                ultimate reason they might not have a “future”.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Lunaria's Statistics" class="singleImg" id="missionImg">

            <h3>What kind of impact has the data-driven approach had on companies?</h3>

            <p>I think one of the biggest things is that a lot of companies don't know where to start or don't know
                what's working. So through our data-driven approach, it is really powerful to be able to show management
                how their investment has changed peoples lives—whether it is a workshop, training, or artifacts that
                make people feel like they belong. Providing anonymity in the service allows employers to get raw
                responses from their employees that can be telling to the real situation happening within their firm.
            </p>

            <h3>How has your involvement as an Entrepreneur in Residence helped you grow your business?
            </h3>

            <p>My experience at Waterloo has definitely helped. I think we're really lucky to be in a community like
                Waterloo which has so many entrepreneurial resources and opportunities to advance your skill set,
                improve your ideas and connect with other entrepreneurs here that have gone through similar things. I am
                really grateful to be a part of this type of ecosystem right now. We currently in the Jump Start program
                with the University of Waterloo and the Accelerator Centre. Through these programs, we get the
                opportunity to engage with mentors and other companies which has been extremely helpful.</p>

            <h3>Market
            </h3>

            <p>Fast fashion is the rapid production of inexpensive clothing to reflect the latest trends. Many fast
                fashion brands have been accused of exploiting workers from third world countries to sustain this
                business model. Today's shoppers are increasingly moving away from fast fashion to sustainable clothing,
                a key contributor to Forever 21's 44-store shut-down and eventual bankruptcy. Although sustainability
                and the green consumer are rising trends, Forever 21's fast fashion competitors such as Fashion Nova,
                Wish, and Zaful do not face the same solvency issues of the former market leader. Therefore, even with
                changing consumer tastes, Forever 21 could have avoided its fate. If the problem isn’t with the market,
                could Forever 21’s strategy be at fault?
            </p>

            <h3>Business Strategy
            </h3>

            <p>It is difficult to identify exactly who Forever 21 is targeted towards, especially when looking at its
                product mix. Forever 21 carries clothing for women, men and children of all sizes, and have also
                ventured into sportswear, swimwear and undergarments.<sup>2</sup> In addition, they carry a large
                assortment of
                additional product lines such as accessories, footwear, skincare and beauty supplies. The only thing
                Forever 21 lacked, however, was one particular target market. Forever 21’s strategy was to saturate as
                many consumer segments as possible with a multitude of products, facilitated by cheap production and
                distribution costs.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, surrounding market positioning, Forever 21 focused its efforts on establishing a presence
                through physical stores in shopping centres and outlet malls. 3 years prior to its bankruptcy filing,
                Forever 21 opened 600 of their 700 outlets, representing an annual growth rate of 91%.<sup>3</sup> This
                strategy
                was unsustainably aggressive relative to H&M’s strategy of steady growth, which has allowed it to
                establish to 5000 stores at an annual growth rate of 5%.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21’s brand presence, emphasizing physical stores, however, may have diverted their attention from
                capturing the growing e-commerce market. For example, Forever 21 did not focus on marketing efforts
                through advertising campaigns such as TV advertising space or celebrity collaborations. Management
                assumed the physical presence of their outlets was sufficient marketing: another justification for their
                slow transition.<sup>5</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Finally, Forever 21 operates using a centralized management. Being a private company with 99% equity
                owned by the Chang family, only a select number of individuals had the power to make impactful
                decisions. With only the Change family as central management, there was a lack of outside parties to
                object to their standard strategy: focus on the now and maximize profits in the short run. In an
                interview with CNN, Do Won Chang explained that being a private company has helped in making decisions
                extremely quickly.<sup>6</sup> Similarly, without external insight, there were no outside consultations
                from
                industry experts who could have provided them with alternative ideas for longstanding success.
            </p>

            <h3>What Went Wrong
            </h3>

            <h3>Their Target Market is the Market</h3>

            <p>Forever 21 was initially targeted for consumers in their 20s, who as Do Won Chang later explained were
                for “Old people [who] wanted to be 21 again, and young people [who] wanted to be 21
                forever”.<sup>7</sup> This
                suggests that their target market was not defined by a particular demographic, but rather an experience.
                To accomplish this, Forever 21 focused on producing clothing according to current fashion trends. This
                allowed them to cater towards a large demographic as all ages looked to buy the latest trend. At the
                time, this worked quite successfully, allowing Forever 21 to capture a large audience with one style.
                But as trends went, so did their appeal. With no specific target market in mind, Forever 21’s resources
                were put towards replicating trends with a rapid pace, and subsequently, they lacked in-depth knowledge
                of a particular demographic. Their lack of a target market became apparent when retailers who knew more
                about specific demographics created products specifically to fit their niche. Coupled with industry
                headwinds, consumers left to look for more tailored customer experiences. </p>

            <p>As a result, their expansive product mix led them to stray away from their original business model,
                trendy and affordable clothing, and instead spread themselves thin across many different demographics.
            </p>

            <p>Although this strategy of “demographic diversification” proved profitable until 2015, it did not prove
                for brand longevity, especially as consumer tastes changed.<sup>8</sup> When they expanded their product
                lines
                to include makeup, home décor, men’s and children’s clothing, Forever 21 struggled to maintain the
                allure that made them successful.</p>

            <p>Compounded by Forever 21’s relatively poor product quality, its inability to capture any single
                demographic segment further cemented Forever 21’s demise.</p>

            <h3>How are People Buying from F21?
            </h3>

            <p>Before filing for bankruptcy, there were 44 stores in Canada and 700 stores worldwide. Forever 21
                aggressively pursued growth through in-store purchases and increasing their retail footprint. However,
                their store expansion led to poor margins and low profitability as increased rental expenses ate up 30%
                of revenues. As the industry turned to e-commerce, Forever 21 was left behind. E-commerce based
                businesses have higher margins and growth within the industry. While Forever 21 concentrated on
                generating sales in their physical stores, competitors made upwards of 30% of revenues through
                e-commerce, nearly double those of Forever 21(16%).<sup>9</sup> Even with surveys demonstrating that
                millennials
                (in the U.S.) made more than half of their purchases online<sup>10</sup>, the focus was still on Forever
                21’s
                physical footprint.
            </p>

            <h3>The Social Media Campaign… Or Lack Thereof?
            </h3>

            <p> Forever 21’s marketing budget reiterates its misunderstanding of current trends, as the US budget went
                from $800,000 in 2017 to under $344,375 by 2018. Similarly, in 2019, only $383,000 was been spent on
                marketing, with search engine optimization using the majority of the budget.<sup>11</sup> Their
                marketing
                efforts paled in comparison to other brands such as H&M, their biggest competitor, which spent a little
                under $100 million on advertising.<sup>12</sup> In a time where consumer engagement through marketing is
                crucial
                , Forever 21 seemed to move in the opposite direction. </p>

            <p>As a result, Forever 21’s social media engagement was severely lacking. Their social media platform was
                scattered and had minimal potential for sales conversions. Firstly, their branding was segmented across
                a multitude of accounts, supposedly targeted towards different demographics. Just to name a few, Forever
                21 had a Canadian account, a men’s account, and a plus size account. When looking at H&M or FashionNova,
                they both utilize their large audiences by posting several posts a day that have links to their
                promotions on their online store. This additional level of interaction of the competitors has raised a
                competitive edge against Forever 21 as not only do they engage further with their audience, but they
                also focus their efforts to generate their online sales through social media platforms.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cost of Copyright
            </h3>

            <p>Legality is also another aspect to consider when looking at the structure and success of Forever 21.
                Forever 21 has been sued over 50 times for allegedly stealing works from Diane von Furstenberg to Gwen
                Stefani and most recently, Ariana Grande.<sup>13</sup> Of all these cases, only one case with the label
                Trovata
                was settled in courts.<sup>14</sup> Forever 21 gets away with these lawsuits because of copyright
                law.<sup>15</sup>
                Specifically, copying a design or a piece of clothing verbatim is not technically illegal because the
                law doesn’t prohibit creative expression and can thus allow Forever 21 to ‘copy’ designs.<sup>16</sup>
                Under the
                Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Act, in the US, it lays out the rights of artists and designers
                to be protected from others copying their works of art, including the designs; however, this legislation
                does not include clothing as it is considered a “useful article”. <sup>17</sup> For this reason, large
                enterprises, such as Forever 21, may be excused of copyright law as there is no legislation that is
                limiting them from copying the designs, especially if they are not patented by the designer.
            </p>

            <p>While Forever 21 has been able to avoid consequences in court room, they have suffered greatly in their
                trial against public opinion. In a recent advertising campaign, Forever 21 victimized Ariana Grande by
                copying her “7 Rings” music video outfit. Although the $10m financial loss wasn’t substantial, their
                brand image was negatively impacted.<sup>18</sup> The backlash of Forever 21’s reputation by prominent
                public
                figures ultimately accelerated the other consequences of their marketing strategy. As there was an
                absence of response to these public claims and no attempt to salvage their reputation, the damage
                incurred by these copyright issues indirectly caused losses greater than the settlement themselves.
            </p>

            <h3>Aftermath and Next Steps
            </h3>

            <p>Due to its poor financials and ineffective marketing position, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                protection which allowed the company to continue operating a few stores. Around 350 stores will be shut
                down globally including all 44 Canadian stores.<sup>19</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21 is a prime example of how the American Dream can quickly turn into a nightmare. Their strategy
                to hastily expand their business without looking at how they were positioning themselves in the market
                ultimately led to their bankruptcy filing.
            </p>

            <p>In the meantime, Forever 21 has focused its efforts on the American market, with an emphasis on
                restructuring and reevaluating their strategy. Due to the nature of Forever 21’s business model, it is
                difficult to determine what the next steps will be. In the meantime however, only assumptions can be
                made regarding Forever 21’s future.
