            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>On April 10, 2019, Canada’s largest wireless companies competed against each other at Canada’s 5G
                Spectrum
                Auction. Being the first 5G auction, the companies sought out to acquire spectrum licenses from the
                federal government which will enable 5G deployment in urban, suburban and rural communities.
                Collectively,
                wireless operators including Rogers, Telus, and Freedom mobile spent a total of $3.47bn to purchase the
                airwaves needed to power next-generation 5G networks.<sup>14</sup></p>

            <p>Investments into 5G technology are becoming an increasingly prevalent patternas operators, equipment
                manufacturers, and device manufacturers alike attempt to capitalize on the expected mass adoption by
                consumers. But what exactly is 5G technology? How did it start, how does it work, and where will it take
                us?</p>

            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>In the 1980s, the first generation of wireless cellular technology emerged, and has been developing ever
                since. What is a generation, and how did we get to number five of them? The graphic below depicts the
                journey from 1G to the now developing 5G over the course of 40 years.<sup>5</sup></p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="svfTimeLine" src="images/article3Images/SVF - timeline.png" alt="SVF Timeline">

            <h3>Difference</h3>

            <p>You probably have a mobile device supported on a 4G network. What is the difference between 4G and 5G?
            </p>

            <img src="images/article3Images/SVF - wavelengths.png" class="singleImage" id="waveLength"
                alt="Wavelenghts Graph">

            <p>In a sense, cell
                phones can be considered two-way radios. For example, when making a call, your voice is convertedinto an
                electrical signal that is transmitted to the nearest cell tower via radio waves, bounced through a
                network of cell towers, to finally reach the individual you are contacting. The same happens when you
                send other forms of data, such as photos and videos.</p>

            <p>Since the 5G network has 5 - 50x shorter wavelengths than its predecessor, users are able to send more
                data in a shorter time period. Contrarily, since these higher frequency signals cannot travel as far,
                more infrastructure is needed to boost signals where 5G is offered.</p>

            <h3>Capabilities</h3>

            <p>You might be thinking, “My phone works pretty well. How much better can 5Gget?” There are 3 main benefits
                to 5G technology: faster speeds, lower latency,and increased connectivity.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will lower latency.</span>​Latency is the response time between a user request
                andaction being taken by a
                simple function, application, or machine. 5G’s capacityfor reduced latency will decrease lag and improve
                streaming applications likeonline gaming, video calling, and interactive live sports.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will increase internet speed and connectivity.</span>​With 5G, downloading an
                HDmovie takes seconds versus 6 minutes for 4G LTE.<sup>13</sup> Furthermore, the greater capacity
                offered by 5G
                will allow support for more devices and more data-intensive tasks, such as “Internet of Things” devices
                in smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart grid management, and remote healthcare. That is, these
                devices
                contain both sensors that collect data, and software to upload data to the cloud. The software would
                then
                able able to directly exchange data with other connected devices, and allow for analytics and insights
                to
                be generated from the data produced.<sup>11</sup></p>

            <h3>Impact</h3>

            <p>Furthermore, 5G is anticipated to have a significant impact on our day-to-day lives in 3 ways:</p>

            <h3>5G will increase data traffic.</h3>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will increase data traffic.</span> 5G will create exponential growth in data
                traffic, allowing for the
                increasing adoption of HD music and video streaming and cloud-native applications. According to Cisco, a
                multinational IT and networking conglomerate, mobile data usage growth alone is expected to increase
                from
                7 to 49 Exabytes (1 Exabyte = 1,048,576 TB) by 2021, representing a 47% CAGR from 2016 to
                2021.​<sup>6</sup></p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will accelerate the internet of things.</span> Currently, all four major US mobile
                operators are involved
                with smart city projects ranging from public transit, water management, and street lighting. Along with
                smart cities, projects related to smart homes and smart buildings are also being taken on, which will
                increase the demand for the 5G technology due to low latency.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G will improve robotics surgery.</span> 5G technology will allow doctors to use VR
                goggles to perform surgery remotely through instant haptic feedback. More recently, Ericsson, a Swedish
                telecommunications company, and King’s College in London showcased this application at the Mobile World
                Congress in Barcelona.<sup>8</sup> This will redefine the way surgeries are conducted by allowing
                patients to
                access to the expertise of specialized surgeons in different parts of the world, making physical
                distance irrelevant.</p>

            <p><span>5G will make self driving car faster and safer.</span> Self-driving cars rely on the data generated
                by hundreds of sensors positioned throughout the vehicle. With existing 4G technology, handling,
                processing, and analysis of this data is not currently possible, due to the fact that these systems need
                to mimic the timing of human reflexes. 5G would ameliorate this issue due to its low latency and high
                speed in transferring large data.<sup>2</sup></p>

            <h3>Concerns</h3>

            <p>5G has far reaching capabilities, and is slated to have a significant positive impact on consumers and
                companies alike. However, there are 2 main issues: political tensions, and potential health effects.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G has sparked political tensions.</span> In May 2019, President Trump banned US tech
                companies from using
                telecom equipment that posed a threat to national security. This led to the Commerce Department placing
                Huawei on a trade blacklist, causing sales of U.S.-made goods to Huawei to be restricted.9 Furthermore,
                telecom giants like Nokia and Ericsson may be forced to move production outside of China in order to
                continue providing equipment to the U.S. In fact, Google recently announced the movement of its Pixel
                smartphone production to China to Vietnam to avoid the looming concerns of US-China trade
                hostilities.<sup>10</sup></p>

            <p><span class="bold">5G has the potential for adverse health effects.</span> Due to 5G networks’ use of
                higher frequency fields, medical professionals are concerned about the possibility of human tissue
                penetration.<sup>16</sup> Depending on the exposure duration, frequency, and temperature increase, this
                could lead to heat stroke and burns. Similarly, the WHO IARC<sup>12</sup>, an agency conducting research
                into the causes of human cancer, the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields associated with 5G networks
                has been classified as a potential human carcinogen.<span>3</span> However, the large majority of
                mainstream of mainstream scientists continue to see no conclusive evidence of harm from cell phone radio
                waves. David Robert Grimes, a cancer researcher at the University of Oxford, suggests, "If phones are
                linked to cancer, we’d expect to see a marked uptick. Yet we do not."<span>4</span></p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <div class="conclusionLayout">

                <p>Although 5G will not replace 4G immediately due to headwinds including infrastructure requirements
                    and
                    health concerns, its adoption is expected to grow significantly over time. By 2025, 49% of North
                    American mobile connections are expected to be running on 5G networks, a significant increase from
                    1% in
                    2019.<sup>1</sup></p>

            </div>

            <p>In conclusion, as a result of exponentially growing investments from telecom enterprises, 5G is an
                incredibly pervasive technology slated to transform Canadian’s way of living: from faster downloads, to
                IOT-connected households, to improved robotic surgery.</p>
