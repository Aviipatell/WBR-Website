            <h3>Introduction
            </h3>

            <p>Today’s globalized economy has created an environment of net dependency. The costs of war have
                significant consequences, not only for nations engaging in conflicts, but for its trading partners as
                well. This impact was seen most predominantly in the 2008 recession, when a housing crisis in the US had
                rampant spillover effects on the global economy. Analysts have termed the current economic scenario a
                strong “recession climate” based on projections of business cycles and bond market yields. But if
                everyone expects a recession, why isn’t it here? Recessions commonly begin where fear of economic
                downturn causes investors to limit spending and creditors to raise payments. According to academia, two
                probable sources of economic turmoil include political incompatibility, and overvaluation bubbles. The
                US-China trade conflict and the WeWork incidents are notable examples. However, global oil supply
                reliability is often excluded from public discourse. The decade of stagflation following the 1973 oil
                supply fluctuations is a stark reminder of oil’s importance, and also demonstrates the effects oil can
                have on global geopolitical forces. The proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia sparked as a result of
                ideological differences on the Shia-Sunni sectarian divide is a noteworthy recent demonstration of the
                instability experienced in the Middle East. Thus, socio-political forces controlling oil production also
                play a noteworthy role in molding the global energy ecosystem.
            </p>

            <img class="singleImage" id="oilStats" src="" alt="Oil production statistics">

            <h3>Importance of Oil
            </h3>

            <p>Why is oil important? The fossil fuel industry is the most valuable industry in history by production,
                drawing value from its reach and resilience. From plastics to transportation, from automation to energy,
                the global industrial revolution wouldn’t have occurred at its pace without oil and its numerous
                by-products. Oil’s omnipresence in global supply chains also stems from the ease with which it can be
                transported relative to other resources. For example, natural gas has been recommended as an alternative
                under UN Sustainability Goals due to its more carbon-neutral nature, but due to its high cost barriers,
                industries continue to rely on oil. Oil’s prevalence is highly disruptive as price increases to oil
                directly translate to spikes in global production costs, an issue affecting the competitiveness of many
                industries.</p>

            <h3>US Oil Trade
            </h3>

            <p>To understand oil’s importance in US foreign policy, an understanding of long-standing oil alliances is
                fundamental. The main threat to the current supply chain is the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
                A proxy war refers to a state of military conflict exercised not directly by any state actors but
                instead via regional non-state organizations to further ideological interests. Iran and Saudi Arabia’s
                stand-off on numerous interlinked regional turmoils affects not only their oil exporting capabilities
                but also the US’s core oil exposure. But, is the US truly dependent on Middle Eastern oil? Contrary to
                general belief, the US is a net exporter of oil, surpassing nations including Saudi Arabia and Russia in
                oil <a
                    href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html">production</a>.
                However, oil markets are geographically-driven due to distribution and transportation
                costs. Since not every country can afford to buy from the US, several suppliers are necessary to sustain
                the global demand. Furthermore, given the market share that Middle Eastern countries control, their
                supply keeps prices in check, as was confirmed by the price surges in the aftermath of September’s drone
                attacks on Saudi Arabia’s state-owned production facilities. Hence, even if the US is able to thrive on
                its own oil supply, its diversified economic interests mandates that its key partners and allies do not
                lose vital supply chains tied to the Middle East. Similarly, China’s rampant economic production lies
                vested in Iranian and Saudi Arabian oil production, establishing the regional oil’s delicate
                geopolitical importance.
            </p>

            <h3>Political Instability in the Middle East
            </h3>

            <p>An important facet of this discussion is the role that instability across oil-supplying nations in the
                Middle East play in leveraging national resources. Three notable incidents of political unrest include
                the 1979 Iranian revolution, the Yemen Houthi insurgency, and the United States’ arms deal with Saudi
                Arabia.</p>

            <p>The House of Pahlavi (Iran’s former royal family), was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, causing a shift
                in policy towards isolationism. This shift had catastrophic implications on access to Iranian oil supply
                by constraining distribution and production <a
                    href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/01/24/how-irans-regional-ambitions-have-developed-since-1979/">channels</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Further instances of instability arise from the exacerbation of existing conflicts across the region,
                particularly Syria and Yemen. The decade-long Yemen Houthi insurgency, along with its accusations of
                Iranian involvement, has stoked a Saudi-allied response, embroiling the country into a civil war spiral.
                The Syrian front has been pronounced by the rise of Islamic State, and Iranian support for the Assad
                government in the wake of public uprisings. While the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) did attempt
                to dissipate conflict through landmark policies enshrined in UNSC Resolutions 2159 (2014) and 2239
                (2015), the sanctions failed to yield substantial effect. This failure was particularly pronounced,
                since major Iranian oil importers like India, Turkey, and China continued to tap into the existing oil
                supplies, nullifying intended repercussions.
            </p>

            <p>Saudi Arabia and the United States have long shared a symbiotic relationship born from mutual objectives
                in the Middle East, including the Israel conflict, and Iran’s position in the status quo. Evidenced by
                the $110B arms deal to help Saudi Arabia purchase US arms in 2017, the United States has asserted its
                motives in regional geopolitics. In spite of international criticism of US support for Saudi Arabia,
                mainly concerning the latter’s poor human rights record and hostile political environment to curb free
                expression, the US remains adamant on asserting the vitality of Saudi Arabia in establishing peace
                across the region’s conflicts. This relationship has inevitably affected the proxy war, with several
                non-state actors being accused of “harbouring violence”, from attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of
                Hormuz, drones near Persian Gulf, and rebel forces on the Yemen border.
            </p>

            <p>The recent drone attack on Aramco, Saudi Arabia’s largest state-owned oil producer, was the largest
                sudden disruption on the International oil supply since the Gulf War. With Aramco responsible for over
                5% of global oil, prices briefly peaked in commodity markets before production was reinitiated. This
                orchestrated a potent demonstration of the political and economic structural power that independent
                actors in the Middle East yield on larger global processes, as demonstrated by the Yom Kippur War.</p>

            <h3>Yom Kippur and the Decade of Stagflation
            </h3>

            <p>The Yom Kippur War in 1973 between Israel and the Arab coalition led by Egypt for control over the
                territories of Sinai and Golan led to blockades of major supply routes due to disputes over the Suez
                Canal, effectively ceasing oil distribution. In combination with the fall of Bretton Woods, a system of
                procedures for major economies to ensure their economic stability, poor investor confidence and rising
                production costs heralded a decade of stagflation, characterized by high unemployment and high
                inflation.
            </p>

            <img src="" alt="Treasury Constant Maturity Rate Graph" class="singleImg" id="treasuryRate">

            <p>Distortions in commodity markets extended the effects of stagflation across major Western economies, with
                sudden peaks in treasury rates, as seen above, and a quarterly negative GDP growth over 1973-1975
                causing the UK filing for bailout with International Monetary Fund in <a
                    href="http://www.ensec.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=155">1976</a>. The price spike was
                detrimental to dependent industries including shipping, logging and mining, with the Swedish
                ship-building industry losing over 3 billion Swedish Krona in 1974. As recovery from this energy crisis
                lasting over 14 quarters, several nations have come to realize the influence of Middle Eastern oil on
                national <a href="https://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/debt/oilcrisis.html">policy-building</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion
            </h3>

            <p>It is unequivocally imperative to recognize a distinction between perceived and actual costs of the
                Middle Eastern war, with the latter based primarily on probable disastrous economic consequences that
                can ensue due to disruptions to oil. With heightened political instability across the region, countries
                must attempt to divest their economic interest away from geopolitics in order to distance themselves
                from its instability. The attack on Aramco, the rise of Iran’s nuclear program, and guerilla proxy
                outbreaks serve to aggregate underlying conflicts, being a formidable reminder that intricately tying
                global economics to political friction is a recipe for recessionary disaster. In addition, while alleged
                religious incoherence continues to feed unrest, decoupling dependency on the region’s oil is our only
                hope to normalize commodity volatility and, in effect, at curbing the next energy crisis.

            <h3>What kind of impact has the data-driven approach had on companies?</h3>

            <p>I think one of the biggest things is that a lot of companies don't know where to start or don't know
                what's working. So through our data-driven approach, it is really powerful to be able to show management
                how their investment has changed peoples lives—whether it is a workshop, training, or artifacts that
                make people feel like they belong. Providing anonymity in the service allows employers to get raw
                responses from their employees that can be telling to the real situation happening within their firm.
            </p>

            <h3>Market
            </h3>

            <p>Fast fashion is the rapid production of inexpensive clothing to reflect the latest trends. Many fast
                fashion brands have been accused of exploiting workers from third world countries to sustain this
                business model. Today's shoppers are increasingly moving away from fast fashion to sustainable clothing,
                a key contributor to Forever 21's 44-store shut-down and eventual bankruptcy. Although sustainability
                and the green consumer are rising trends, Forever 21's fast fashion competitors such as Fashion Nova,
                Wish, and Zaful do not face the same solvency issues of the former market leader. Therefore, even with
                changing consumer tastes, Forever 21 could have avoided its fate. If the problem isn’t with the market,
                could Forever 21’s strategy be at fault?
            </p>

            <h3>Business Strategy
            </h3>

            <p>It is difficult to identify exactly who Forever 21 is targeted towards, especially when looking at its
                product mix. Forever 21 carries clothing for women, men and children of all sizes, and have also
                ventured into sportswear, swimwear and undergarments.<sup>2</sup> In addition, they carry a large
                assortment of
                additional product lines such as accessories, footwear, skincare and beauty supplies. The only thing
                Forever 21 lacked, however, was one particular target market. Forever 21’s strategy was to saturate as
                many consumer segments as possible with a multitude of products, facilitated by cheap production and
                distribution costs.
            </p>

            <p>Furthermore, surrounding market positioning, Forever 21 focused its efforts on establishing a presence
                through physical stores in shopping centres and outlet malls. 3 years prior to its bankruptcy filing,
                Forever 21 opened 600 of their 700 outlets, representing an annual growth rate of 91%.<sup>3</sup> This
                strategy
                was unsustainably aggressive relative to H&M’s strategy of steady growth, which has allowed it to
                establish to 5000 stores at an annual growth rate of 5%.<sup>4</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21’s brand presence, emphasizing physical stores, however, may have diverted their attention from
                capturing the growing e-commerce market. For example, Forever 21 did not focus on marketing efforts
                through advertising campaigns such as TV advertising space or celebrity collaborations. Management
                assumed the physical presence of their outlets was sufficient marketing: another justification for their
                slow transition.<sup>5</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Finally, Forever 21 operates using a centralized management. Being a private company with 99% equity
                owned by the Chang family, only a select number of individuals had the power to make impactful
                decisions. With only the Change family as central management, there was a lack of outside parties to
                object to their standard strategy: focus on the now and maximize profits in the short run. In an
                interview with CNN, Do Won Chang explained that being a private company has helped in making decisions
                extremely quickly.<sup>6</sup> Similarly, without external insight, there were no outside consultations
                from
                industry experts who could have provided them with alternative ideas for longstanding success.
            </p>

            <h3>What Went Wrong
            </h3>

            <h3>Their Target Market is the Market</h3>

            <p>Forever 21 was initially targeted for consumers in their 20s, who as Do Won Chang later explained were
                for “Old people [who] wanted to be 21 again, and young people [who] wanted to be 21
                forever”.<sup>7</sup> This
                suggests that their target market was not defined by a particular demographic, but rather an experience.
                To accomplish this, Forever 21 focused on producing clothing according to current fashion trends. This
                allowed them to cater towards a large demographic as all ages looked to buy the latest trend. At the
                time, this worked quite successfully, allowing Forever 21 to capture a large audience with one style.
                But as trends went, so did their appeal. With no specific target market in mind, Forever 21’s resources
                were put towards replicating trends with a rapid pace, and subsequently, they lacked in-depth knowledge
                of a particular demographic. Their lack of a target market became apparent when retailers who knew more
                about specific demographics created products specifically to fit their niche. Coupled with industry
                headwinds, consumers left to look for more tailored customer experiences. </p>

            <p>As a result, their expansive product mix led them to stray away from their original business model,
                trendy and affordable clothing, and instead spread themselves thin across many different demographics.
            </p>

            <p>Although this strategy of “demographic diversification” proved profitable until 2015, it did not prove
                for brand longevity, especially as consumer tastes changed.<sup>8</sup> When they expanded their product
                lines
                to include makeup, home décor, men’s and children’s clothing, Forever 21 struggled to maintain the
                allure that made them successful.</p>

            <p>Compounded by Forever 21’s relatively poor product quality, its inability to capture any single
                demographic segment further cemented Forever 21’s demise.</p>

            <h3>How are People Buying from F21?
            </h3>

            <p>Before filing for bankruptcy, there were 44 stores in Canada and 700 stores worldwide. Forever 21
                aggressively pursued growth through in-store purchases and increasing their retail footprint. However,
                their store expansion led to poor margins and low profitability as increased rental expenses ate up 30%
                of revenues. As the industry turned to e-commerce, Forever 21 was left behind. E-commerce based
                businesses have higher margins and growth within the industry. While Forever 21 concentrated on
                generating sales in their physical stores, competitors made upwards of 30% of revenues through
                e-commerce, nearly double those of Forever 21(16%).<sup>9</sup> Even with surveys demonstrating that
                millennials
                (in the U.S.) made more than half of their purchases online<sup>10</sup>, the focus was still on Forever
                21’s
                physical footprint.
            </p>

            <h3>The Social Media Campaign… Or Lack Thereof?
            </h3>

            <p> Forever 21’s marketing budget reiterates its misunderstanding of current trends, as the US budget went
                from $800,000 in 2017 to under $344,375 by 2018. Similarly, in 2019, only $383,000 was been spent on
                marketing, with search engine optimization using the majority of the budget.<sup>11</sup> Their
                marketing
                efforts paled in comparison to other brands such as H&M, their biggest competitor, which spent a little
                under $100 million on advertising.<sup>12</sup> In a time where consumer engagement through marketing is
                crucial
                , Forever 21 seemed to move in the opposite direction. </p>

            <p>As a result, Forever 21’s social media engagement was severely lacking. Their social media platform was
                scattered and had minimal potential for sales conversions. Firstly, their branding was segmented across
                a multitude of accounts, supposedly targeted towards different demographics. Just to name a few, Forever
                21 had a Canadian account, a men’s account, and a plus size account. When looking at H&M or FashionNova,
                they both utilize their large audiences by posting several posts a day that have links to their
                promotions on their online store. This additional level of interaction of the competitors has raised a
                competitive edge against Forever 21 as not only do they engage further with their audience, but they
                also focus their efforts to generate their online sales through social media platforms.

            <h3>The Cost of Copyright
            </h3>

            <p>Legality is also another aspect to consider when looking at the structure and success of Forever 21.
                Forever 21 has been sued over 50 times for allegedly stealing works from Diane von Furstenberg to Gwen
                Stefani and most recently, Ariana Grande.<sup>13</sup> Of all these cases, only one case with the label
                Trovata
                was settled in courts.<sup>14</sup> Forever 21 gets away with these lawsuits because of copyright
                law.<sup>15</sup>
                Specifically, copying a design or a piece of clothing verbatim is not technically illegal because the
                law doesn’t prohibit creative expression and can thus allow Forever 21 to ‘copy’ designs.<sup>16</sup>
                Under the
                Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Act, in the US, it lays out the rights of artists and designers
                to be protected from others copying their works of art, including the designs; however, this legislation
                does not include clothing as it is considered a “useful article”. <sup>17</sup> For this reason, large
                enterprises, such as Forever 21, may be excused of copyright law as there is no legislation that is
                limiting them from copying the designs, especially if they are not patented by the designer.
            </p>

            <p>While Forever 21 has been able to avoid consequences in court room, they have suffered greatly in their
                trial against public opinion. In a recent advertising campaign, Forever 21 victimized Ariana Grande by
                copying her “7 Rings” music video outfit. Although the $10m financial loss wasn’t substantial, their
                brand image was negatively impacted.<sup>18</sup> The backlash of Forever 21’s reputation by prominent
                public
                figures ultimately accelerated the other consequences of their marketing strategy. As there was an
                absence of response to these public claims and no attempt to salvage their reputation, the damage
                incurred by these copyright issues indirectly caused losses greater than the settlement themselves.
            </p>

            <h3>Aftermath and Next Steps
            </h3>

            <p>Due to its poor financials and ineffective marketing position, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
                protection which allowed the company to continue operating a few stores. Around 350 stores will be shut
                down globally including all 44 Canadian stores.<sup>19</sup>
            </p>

            <p>Forever 21 is a prime example of how the American Dream can quickly turn into a nightmare. Their strategy
                to hastily expand their business without looking at how they were positioning themselves in the market
                ultimately led to their bankruptcy filing.
            </p>

            <p>In the meantime, Forever 21 has focused its efforts on the American market, with an emphasis on
                restructuring and reevaluating their strategy. Due to the nature of Forever 21’s business model, it is
                difficult to determine what the next steps will be. In the meantime however, only assumptions can be
                made regarding Forever 21’s future.
